Automated Talent Screening (ATS) System using Flask and Gemini API

This project is an ATS (Automated Talent Screening) system designed to streamline the hiring process by matching user resumes to job descriptions. Built using Flask for the backend and integrated with the Gemini API, the system analyzes resumes uploaded by users and compares them to the requirements listed in the job description. The output includes:

Percentage Match: A percentage score that indicates how well the resume aligns with the job description.
Strengths and Weaknesses: A detailed analysis that highlights the areas where the resume meets the job criteria and where it falls short.
This tool provides an efficient way for recruiters to quickly assess candidate suitability, helping to speed up the hiring process.
